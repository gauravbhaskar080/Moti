  <h1>Life in Kendriya Vidyalaya:-</h1>
  <p>Kendriya Vidyalaya is one of the best place I ever encounter in my life.<br>I spent 7 years of my life in Kendriya Vidyalaya. And I have not got enough words to describe how it feels. Its an un-forgettable and everlasting experience.<br>The name
    Kendriya Vidyalaya has the aura of its own. And I being a KVIAN already feel proud about it.<br>KV has a unique culture. Its different because:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>UNITY IN DIVERSITY:</b> It does not make the child feel that he/she belongs to somewhere else. Students from all India, different cultures study altogether. HENCE UNITED
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>BEST TEACHING:</b> As the faculty is selected on All India Examination and merit basis, all the teachers are highly educated who try their best to give their 1000 percent to their students.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>ACCESS TO CULTURAL AND SPORTS ACTIVITY AT NATIONAL LEVEL:</b> Kendriya Vidyalaya not only offers inter class competitions, but also organises Cluster, Regional and National level competition for Indoor/Outdoor sports, Creativity, And
      cultural
      activities as well. It helps develop the students physically and mentally as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>LIFE LONG FRIENDS:</b>Last but not least, my KV, my School gave me so many friends that complete my life. Friends for sure make most of our life.

    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>So yes, if asked I will surely suggest KV for ever and ever.</li>
  <li>It gave me my identity, that will stay with me forever. And I'm proud of that.</li>

  <h1>How popular is the Shyama Prasad Mukherji College of DU?</h1>
  <p>I'm the student of Shyama prasad mukherji college…the college is not too popular as it is always underestimated..we have to mention people specifically <i>“yes , this college too belong to delhi university”</i>; but overall the college is outstanding at
  most of the points..faculty is very good,there is no politics at all,neat and clean campass,punctuality of classes,canteen,staff,labs almost everything. Taking admission in this college is not a loss at all if you are focused with ur studies..infact
  it is much better than the most of the north campass colleges in terms of studies…the societies of these colleges is too progressing day by day..so overall not popular but reputed college.</p>
